## About

<small>
    Well hello, world.
</small>

I am a software developer based in Durham, NC. Right now I am working mostly with Javascript (Backbone and MarionnetteJS), PHP, and Jenkins. I'm also an active member of the Ruby community and enjoy attending open source events like <a href="https://acuriousloop.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Ruby for Good</a> and local meetups. I'm also a teaching assistant at <a href="https://acuriousloop.wordpress.com" target="_blank">University of North Carolina Chapel Hill's Coding Bootcamp</a> and <a href="https://acuriousloop.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Triangle Railsbridge</a>.
